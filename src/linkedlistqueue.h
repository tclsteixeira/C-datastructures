 * Description: Implements a generic queue in C with a linkedlist.
 *
 *
 * Definition:
 *
 * 		A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends
 * 		and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.
 *
 * 		We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made
 * 		at one end, and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.
 * 		The element which is first pushed into the order, the operation is first
 * 		performed on that.
 *
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 *
 * 		O(1), The time complexity of both operations enqueue() and dequeue() is O(1)
 * 		as it only changes a few pointers in both operations.
 *
 *	Auxiliary Space:
 *
 *		O(1), The auxiliary Space of both operations enqueue() and dequeue() is O(1)
 *		as constant extra space is required.
 *
 *
 * Applications of Queue:
 *
 * 		Queue is used when things donâ€™t have to be processed immediately, but have
 * 		to be processed in First In First Out order like Breadth First Search. This
 * 		property of Queue makes it also useful in following kind of scenarios.
 *
 *     	- When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU
 *     	  scheduling, Disk Scheduling.
 *     	- When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at
 *     	  same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO Buffers,
 *     	  pipes, file IO, etc.
 *     	- Queue can be used as an essential component in various other data structures.
 *
 * Basic Operations on Queue:
 *
 *    enqueue(): Inserts an element at the end of the queue i.e. at the rear end.
 *    dequeue(): This operation removes and returns an element that is at the front end of the queue.
 *    front(): This operation returns the element at the front end without removing it.
 *    rear(): This operation returns the element at the rear end without removing it.
 *    isEmpty(): This operation indicates whether the queue is empty or not.
 *    isFull(): This operation indicates whether the queue is full or not.
 *    size(): This operation returns the size of the queue i.e. the total number of elements it contains.
