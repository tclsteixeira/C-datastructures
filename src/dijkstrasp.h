 * Description: C Headers for Dijkstra shortest path algorithm.
 *
 * Dijkstra algorithm is a single source shortest path (SSSP) algorithm for grapths
 * with non-negative edge weights.
 *
 * Depending on how the algorithm is implemented and what data structures are used,
 * the time complexity is typically O(E*log(V)) which is competitive against other
 * shortest path algorithms.
 *
 *
 * Complexity Analysis:
 *
 * 		Time Complexity: O(ELogV), where V is the number of vertices and E is the
 * 						 number of edges.
 *  	Auxiliary Space: O(V2)
 *
 *
 * Overall, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is a simple and efficient way to find the shortest
 * path in a graph with non-negative edge weights. However, it may not work well with
 * graphs that have negative edge weights or cycles. In such cases, more advanced
 * algorithms such as the Bellman-Ford algorithm or the Floyd-Warshall algorithm may
 * be used.
